The exercise requested to:
"Write a python or bash script that counts the number of script files in a directory subdividing it by the shebang interpreter.

An example output in macOS is:
countexec /usr/bin
81 #!/usr/bin/perl
52 #!/usr/bin/perl5.18
47 #!/bin/sh
44 #!/usr/bin/perl5.28
22 #!/usr/sbin/dtrace -s
..."

To accomplish this task I've written a python script with a main function that use the directory name as an argument.
To gather the argument I decided to use argsparse in order to provide also an help for the argument used if needed. The function recursively check the files for non-binary (aka text) files and read the first line and looks for the shabang interpreter [options], add all the results to a defaultdict as key when missing and add a +1 to counter (value) when already present.
